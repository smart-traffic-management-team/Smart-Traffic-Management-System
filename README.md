## About the Project
This project addresses urban traffic congestion and enables emergency vehicles (such as ambulances) to navigate intersections more efficiently.
- A webcam to count vehicles with YOLO (a computer vision tool).
- A microphone to detect ambulance sirens with YAMNet.
- Raspberry Pi to process data.
- FPGA to control traffic lights in real-time.

We built and tested it on a small model of a traffic junction at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (2025).

## Features

- üö¶ Counts vehicles to adjust green light times for busy roads.  
- üöë Detects ambulance sirens and gives them priority (green light).  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Uses FPGA for fast and reliable traffic light control.


## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Basys 3 FPGA, Webcam, Microphone, LED Traffic Lights.
- **Software**: Python, Verilog, YOLOv8, YAMNet, OpenCV, PyAudio.
- **Tools**: Git, Vivado (for FPGA), TensorFlow Lite.

## How It Works
1. Webcam captures traffic and YOLO counts vehicles.
2. Microphone listens for sirens and YAMNet confirms if it‚Äôs an ambulance.
3. Raspberry Pi processes the data and sends instructions to the FPGA.
4. FPGA changes traffic lights to reduce congestion or prioritize ambulances.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Traffic-Management-System.git
   cd Smart-Traffic-Management-System
2. Install Python libraries
3. Add YOLO and YAMNet models to models/
4. Program the FPGA with src/verilog/fpga_blink_new.v using Vivado.
5. Run the main script
    python src/python/traffic_control.py

## Results

- Successfully controlled traffic lights based on vehicle count.  
- Detected ambulances using siren sounds and video.  
- Tested on a mini traffic junction model.  
- **Challenge**: Audio processing was hard on Raspberry Pi, so we tested it separately on a laptop.
